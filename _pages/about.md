# <br/>About me
**TL;DR:** Swedish guy doing software development as a career, and photography as a hobby.

**Background:**<br/>
Hailing from the very north of Sweden, I'm a 21 year old IT-Engineering student at Uppsala university. At age 14, I programmed my first game and got to combine both my creativity together with a passion for problem solving - *I was instantly hooked*.

**Nowadays:**<br/>
When I'm not studying, I now spend my free time developing personal projects such as this site, volunteering for the Swedish Astronomical Youth Association and exploring different kinds of photography (analog film and astrophotograpy are personal favorites).
