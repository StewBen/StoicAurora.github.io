# About me

Hailing from the very north of Sweden, I'm a 21 year old IT-Engineering student at Uppsala university. My early career ambitions had a clear focus towards the natural sciences, with astronomy in particular. However, after writing my first game at age 14, these ambitions began to shift. Programming offered me a fresh and new creativity aspect when problem solving - I was instantly hooked. 

After graduation I dream of a position where I ideally get to combine both my interest for space and programming, similar to an intership I had at a satelite manufacturer.

I spend my spare time developing personal projects (like this site), volunteering for the Swedish Astronomical Youth Association and exploring different kinds of photography (analog and astrophotograpy are personal favorites).
