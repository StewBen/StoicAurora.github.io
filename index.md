<!-- # <br/>Hi, I'm Viktor. An IT-Engineer with a Photographer's eye. -->
# Hi, I'm Viktor. 
Welcome to my little corner of the World (Wide Web).<br/>On here you will find:

* **About:**
Get to know the guy who's name is in the URL. Learn my background and what I'm up to now.

* **Portfolio:**
Like a fancier GitHub profile. Read my CV together with case studies from my best work over the years.

* **Gallery:**
Curated picks of my photos and snapshots from everyday life. Hosted in a clean, minimal style on VSCO.

* **Blog:**
Here I write about my work on current projects or whatever else is on my mind.

<!-- Hailing from the very north of Sweden, I'm a 21 year old IT-Engineering student at Uppsala university. At age 14, I programmed my first game and got to combine both my creativity together with a passion for problem solving - *I was instantly hooked*.  -->

<!-- My early career ambitions had a clear focus towards the natural sciences with astronomy in particular.After graduation I dream of a position where I ideally get to combine both my interest for space and programming, similar to an intership I had at a satelite manufacturer. -->

<!-- **Nowadays:**<br/> -->
<!-- When I'm not studying, I now spend my free time developing personal projects such as this site, volunteering for the Swedish Astronomical Youth Association and exploring different kinds of photography (analog film and astrophotograpy are personal favorites). -->
