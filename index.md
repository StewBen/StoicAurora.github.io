# ...and a Software-Engineer *(I made this website)*.

In practice that means I can both:
- produce **great looking designs**
*and*
- turn those designs **into reality**.

If you think that sounds interesting - you've come to the right place.
Here on my personal site you will find: 

## About me

Who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch with me.

## Portfolio 

My personal CV coupled with case studies from the projects that I am the most proud about being a part of.

## Photo Gallery

Curated collections that feature my very best photos. Most together with the stories and thoughts behind them.

## Personal blog
My very own little corner of the World (Wide Web) where I get to write about whatever is on my mind.
