# <br/>About me
{: #myid1}

Hailing from the very north of Sweden, I am a 21 year old IT-Engineering student at Uppsala university. My early career ambitions had a clear focus towards the natural sciences with astronomy in particular. However, my ambitions began to shift after coding my first game at age 14. Suddenly I got to use a brand new type of creativity when problem solving - I was instantly hooked. 

<!-- After graduation I dream of a position where I ideally get to combine both my interest for space and programming, similar to an intership I had at a satelite manufacturer. -->

Nowadays, when I'm not studying, I spend my free time developing personal projects (like this site), volunteering for the Swedish Astronomical Youth Association and exploring different kinds of photography (analog film and astrophotograpy are personal favorites).
